# Madblocks

## About Madblocks :

Madblocks is a 2D top view game reflexion where you will have to overcome logical puzzles and stuff. 
The game is developped in C language using SDL2.

## For who ? :
Madblock can be played by everyone. Players who love reflexion games will be really happy with this game. This game is mostly oriented to casual players and there's no stress about dying because there's no death in this game. Really only reflexion and creativity (and fun also) with a map editor to create your own level. 

## Story : 

You're a young magician destined to be promoted councillor of the King. But even after many years of determined work in the textbooks, you still have a quest, an initiatory way you must accomplish to reveal your true self. You have to penetrate the mind and soul of your master, Dunkha, to learn an unexpected power. You sense a tragic end but nothing will have prepared you for what awaits you in the deep complexities of a person, your master, your friend.

Madblocks will immerse you in a a dark universe where thoughts will be your only weapon. Will you succeed in foiling the traps of mind to reach the strength and the foresight necessary to your future rank? Or will you lose yourself forever in the interior meanderings, tormented by the past choices of your mentor? 

## Controls :

You can use arrows to move in the four direction. Your character will move one square in the direction asked if he has the possibility.

## Goals :

The goal is to pass each stage. On each stage, many obstacles will be present such as movable blocks, traps, teleporters and so many others surprises that you will discover in game !  Lots of thoughts will be needed to finish each stage !

## Here's a descriptions of the main blocks :

**Wall :** A block that you can't pass through

**Movable block :** It's a block that you can push in the four direction when you're walking in this direction. If there's an obstacle behind it, the block will not move.

Here are some cases where you can and cannot push a movable block :

On the last case with the key, it's one of the exception with movable block. When you will push the block, the key will also move.

**Teleporters :** they come in pairs, and stepping into one takes you to the other immediately
There are two types of teleporter. One will be only one way and the other will be two way. It means that on the one way, after you have teleported, you will have no way to go back in it contrary to the two way teleporter which you can take as much as you want.

One way teleporter : ![alt tag](https://github.com/hamtaro75/madblocks/blob/master/Madblocks/img/Blocks/portal%20one%20way.gif)
Two way teleporter : ![alt tag](https://github.com/hamtaro75/madblocks/blob/master/Madblocks/img/Blocks/portal%20double%20way.gif)

**Key :** It's an object which will open a key door.

Key and the door with it : ![alt tag](https://github.com/hamtaro75/madblocks/blob/master/Madblocks/img/Blocks/Key.gif) ![alt tag](https://github.com/hamtaro75/madblocks/blob/master/Madblocks/img/Blocks/door%20key%20closed.gif)


**Pressure plate :** When something is on this block, it will engage a mechanism. This mechanism can be for example a door which will open or a block or key who appears and so on.

## Map editor :

The game has a map editor which allows you to create new maps to share with your friends or try someone's level ! You can save your creations and open them when you want and try them to see if it's okay.

Here's the really first version I made of the map editor and the first map created with it :

And to finish here's some pictures of how the game looks like actually !

#notes

All the images presented in this files are temporary. The graphics of this game will totally change later.
One of the thing I'm thinking to is to pass the game in 2D isometric !
Here a picture of the test I made :

Have fun on Madblocks !
